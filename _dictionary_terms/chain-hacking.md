title:  Chain-hacking
---
An advanced hacking method where a hacker remotely hacks through a "chain" of servers in order to conceal his location to avoid being traced. Chain-hacking can be accomplished by using Telnet to remote into one server, and then another, and so on, making him untraceable by the F.B.I.
