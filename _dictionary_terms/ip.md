title:  IP (Internet Protocol) Address
---
An IP Address (or just IP for short) is a numerical number assigned to every computer and server on the internet. They are often hidden by their server and are the first thing a hacker must have in order to hack it. [Tools such as Ping (provided by Windows) can be used to steal them](/tutorials/advanced-hacking-methods).
