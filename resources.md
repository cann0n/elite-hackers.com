  <p>Hacking is a complex subject with lots of terminology, which is why I began maintaining the Hacker's Dictionary. This dictionary is the first place to turn if you come across a hacking-related word you don't understand and want to learn exactly what it means.</p>

Because the internet wasn't invented yet and they didn't have blogs, they would write them using Microsoft Windows Notepad. When I read a hacking text file I find useful, I post it here.</p>
