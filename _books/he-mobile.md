description: "If you know anyone with a Linux/UNIX/Windows/Iphone/Macintosh smartphone that you want to hack, then you should definitely read this book. I used the information in this book along with ping and telnet to hack a person's phone, drop their calls, listen on their phone conversations, and read their text messages."
