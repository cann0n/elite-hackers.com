title:  "Hacking Exposed Industrial Control Systems: ICS and SCADA Security Secrets & Solutions"
description: "This is a new hacking book dedicated to hacking physical hardware systems that control things we use. It's good if you want to hack an automatic garage door, security cameras, alarm systems, and database mainframes. One time I wanted to leave school, so I used the methods in this book to set off the fire alarm. This book can be very dangerous and should only be used if you are elite."
