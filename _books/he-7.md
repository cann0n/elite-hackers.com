title:  "Hacking Exposed 7: Network Security Secrets and Solutions"
description: If you haven't read a hacking book, you should start here. This is the best hacking book I own. After you <a href="/tutorials/getting-started">learn the basics in my Getting Started article</a>, you can start to read this book. It covers a lot of network hacking and exposes some of the best secrets that elite hackers know. After reading this book, I was able to hack my school network with Telnet brute forcing and change my grades.
