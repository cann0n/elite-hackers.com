title:  "Hacking Exposed Wireless, Third Edition: Wireless Security Secrets & Solutions"
description: "Hacking wireless networks is my favorite. Almost 100% of networking done today is done wirelessly, including phones. If you manage to read through this book, you will learn how to hack wireless networks. One time I was in a Starbucks and I hacked their wifi, which allowed me to hack their ordering system and get free drinks. The best thing about wireless hacking is that it's nearly impossible to trace you because you don't have to be in the building!"
