title:  "Hacking Exposed Web Applications, Third Edition"
description: "Web sites have become really popular over the last couple years. Web sites even control bank accounts and social media sites like Facebook and MySpace, which is what makes this book REALLY valuable. This book will teach you how to hack 90% of the web sites out there, even if they're written in a secure lanuage like HTML 5 or C (My site can't be hacked though, becuase it's written in C++ which is more secure)."
