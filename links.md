summary: I've been involved with the underground for a long time. Odds are if you were to drop the name schiz0id, people would immediately engage you in conversation. I keep a tight watch on what is going on in the hacker community, and these links are without a doubt the best resources online. There are many groups and people dedicated to hacking, keeping up with the information on these sites is crucial to the everyday life of a hacker. Only the best of the best are linked on my site.
