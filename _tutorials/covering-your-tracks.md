## Internet Cookies ##

Every time you view a web page, Internet Explorer stores what's called a cookie on your computer. Cookies are useful when you need to use the back button to go to the previous page, or to look through your browser history. A good hacker knows how to delete cookies and remain untraceable.



### Why Cookies Are Bad ###

For a hacker, internet cookies can be very dangerous if they don't know what they're doing.  Unwanted cookies can land the best hacker in jail. Kevin Mitnick was a famous hacker who was caught because the F.B.I. traced his browser history. This section will teach you how to not get caught like that.

### Deleting your Cookies to Remain Untraceable ###

Deleting your cookies is easy, and how you do it varies on which version of Internet Explorer you're using. Since Microsoft is constantly improving Internet Explorer, I'm not going to cover it here. Instead, here are links to the instructions for each version:

* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 6" href="#">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 6</a>
* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 7" href="#">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 7</a>
* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 8" href="#">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 8</a>

## InPrivate Browsing for Hacking Sessions ##

It's not always a good idea to have *all* of your history cleared. If the F.B.I. seizes your computer and doesn't see any history, it will look suspicious.
