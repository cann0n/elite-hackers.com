## Internet Cookies ##

Every time you view a web page, Internet Explorer stores what's called a cookie on your computer. Cookies are useful when you need to use the back button to go to the previous page, or to look through your browser history. A good hacker knows how to delete cookies and remain untraceable.



### Why Cookies Are Bad ###

For a hacker, internet cookies can be very dangerous if they don't know what they're doing.  Unwanted cookies can land the best hacker in jail. Kevin Mitnick was a famous hacker who was caught because the F.B.I. traced his browser history. This section will teach you how to not get caught like that.

### Deleting your Cookies to Remain Untraceable ###

Deleting your cookies is easy, and how you do it varies on which version of Internet Explorer you're using. Since Microsoft is constantly improving Internet Explorer, I'm not going to cover it here. Instead, here are links to the instructions for each version:

* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 6" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278835">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 6</a>
* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 7" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278835">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 7</a>
* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 8" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278835">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 8</a>
* <a target="_blank" title="Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 9" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278835">Deleting your cookies/history in Internet Explorer 9</a>

## InPrivate Browsing for Hacking Sessions ##

It's not always a good idea to have *all* of your history cleared. If the F.B.I. seizes your computer and doesn't see *any* history, it will look suspicious. If you have the latest version of Internet Explorer, you can open a new window that doesn't leave any cookies.

Once you're done hacking, all you have to do is close the window and any evidence will be gone without a trace. This is what is known as InPrivate browsing, and many hackers have used it to avoid being caught. I always use InPrivate Browsing when I'm hacking at school.

Microsoft takes security very seriously, which is why I use them. You can <a target="_blank" title="Untracable hacking with Microsoft Internet Explorer" href="https://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/features/in-private">read more about InPrivate browsing</a> on their web site and how to use it.

## HTTPS ##

**Hidden Text Transmission Protocol Security** (or HTTPS for short) is a transmission method that Internet Explorer uses to encrypt the website address you're visiting. If the F.B.I. is <a href="#ping?">using ping</a> and gets your IP address, then they can track the web sites you're visiting **in real time**, which means they'll know even if you delete your cookies afterwards.

### Using HTTPS ###

If you're browsing a site and want to prevent anyone from knowing where you're going, put `https://` in front of the `www` portion of the domain. You should always use HTTPS when browsing hacking sites like this one because the government is always trying to keep track of hackers. For example, the untracable address for this site is:

[https://www.elite-hackers.com](https://www.elite-hackers.com)

Every link on this site uses HTTPS.
