  <h1>Welcome, hackers!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the main page of The Elite Hackers Site. My name is schiz0id, and I have been hacking since I was 13, well over 2 years. People know me as one of the elite, one who knows what they're doing. Since hacking is a true art that isn't learned overnight (more like months), I decided to help those who are destined to master the art of hacking. I will bestow upon all of you information that will guide you along your way, all the way to the end.</p>

  <h2>Who this site is for</h2>
  <p>This site is meant for real hackers. If you're not serious about becoming&nbsp;an elite hacker, then leave. Otherwise, look at the following list and ask yourself if you've ever been through one or more of these situations:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>I want to learn how to program in code.</li>
    <li>I think my significant other (girlfriend,&nbsp;boyfriend, husband, wife, fianc√©)&nbsp;is cheating on me and I want to hack their Facebook or e-mail account to find out.</li>
    <li>I'm not doing good in school and I want to change my grades.</li>
    <li>I want to have the best hacker desktop.</li>
    <li>I want to bypass my school's firewall and look at blocked web sites.</li>
