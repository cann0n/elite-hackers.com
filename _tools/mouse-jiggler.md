title:  "Mouse Jiggler"
description: Mouse Jigglers come in handy when you don't want your victim's computer to go to sleep. It also prevents their computer from locking so it won't prompt you for a password! You can also program it to automatically point and click, which is good for spamming games and DDOSing web sites!
